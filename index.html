            <p>Hi, I’m Bec,</p>
            <p>I’m currently a HR Generalist, supporting an integration project standardising and improving HR processes. I have a strong background in supporting organisation restructures from an end user system perspective which has sparked my desire to gain hands on ‘back end’ tech skills to pivot in my career.</p>
            <p>I’m currently part of the Brisbane SheCodes cohort where I’ll get to do just that: learn and work on projects using HTML/CSS, Python, Django and React.</p>
            <p>Outside of this, I am obsessed with dogs (but who isn’t), and love to go out with friends and family for dinner and drinks.</p>
