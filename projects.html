                    <p>My task was to create a portfolio site to showcase my work; and this site is the outcome of this project.</p>
                    <p>To meet the requirements of this project, my site needed to include a profile picture, biography, a functional contact form, sections dedicated to projects I have worked on and links to external sites (I have links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the content requirements, the technical requirements were to have at least 2 pages, be deployed on GitHub, be responsive and use semantic HTML.</p>
                    <p>I also included the following additional features: a different font colour when hovering over links, and a a simple JavaScript function to display a hidden message on my home page.</p>

                <div class="project_text">
                    <p>For this project, I was provided with two json files containing weather data; one contained a 5 day forecast, the other historical data for a 24 hour period. My task was to convert the data into something useful.</p>
                    <p>The requirements for this project were to write a Python script that produced: a summary of the forecast, a summary of each day and needed to meet specific output formatting, and pass tests that checked functions in my code (specifically the functions to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, calculate the Mean and the overall output function).</p>
                    <p>The second part of this project required two graphs to be produced, showing the minimum and maximum temperatures for each day, and the minimum, minimum ‘real feel’ and minimum ‘real feel shade’ temperatures. I used Plotly to produce two line graphs with the expected output.</p>
                    <p>Additional points to note were that all dates and times in the output needed to be in a human readable format, all temperatures needed to be converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius and displayed accordingly, all graphs needed a main title, titles for the X & Y axis and a legend.</p>

                    <p>For the Django project, I was tasked with creating a SheCodes News website.</p>
                    <p>The news website needed to be set up to allow users to read news stories, and authors to create them.</p>
                    <p>The requirements of this project included having functional login/logout buttons for users, a user account view to see their profile information, and show/hide relevant information depending on if the user is logged in or out.</p>
                    <p>This project allowed for some more creative licence - I updated the colour scheme and font, and added some personality to the forms, along with links back to other pages to make the end user experience more streamlined when navigating the site. </p>

                <div class="project_text">
                    <p>The Django Rest Framework (DRF) project was Part A of a wider Crowdfunding project  - where I created my own Crowdfunding site. </p>
                    <p>A requirement for the wider project included the completion of an MVP plan - the minimum viable product. This needed to include the title of the website, the purpose and target audience, an API specification, a database schema, wireframes, colour scheme and fonts to be used.</p>
                    <p>For Part A, I built the backend database and set up API end points using DRF, and tested them using Insomnia. </p>
                    <p>The GET method was set up to allow all projects to be viewed, as well as individual projects, to view all pledges and individual pledges, and to view user data.</p>
                    <p>The POST method was set up to allow a new user to register themselves on the site, to create a new project, to be able to pledge to a project, and to obtain a token for authorisation. </p>
                    <p>The PUT method was set up to allow a user to edit their own details, edit their project or allow pledges to be edited.</p>
                    <p>The DELETE method was set up to allow a user to delete their project, pledge and their own user account. </p>

                    <p>The React project formed Part B of the wider Crowdfunding project.</p>
                    <p>React was used to create the actual website for my Crowdfunding site; <a href="https://rocky-tor-24297.herokuapp.com/">DogShare</a></p>
                    <p>Functional pages and forms were set up to link to the API endpoints created in DRF and the site was deployed via Heroku. </p>
                    <p>The site includes the ability to register as a new user, login, view projects, create projects and edit projects. The pledge option is not currently functional. There is also a custom '404 page not found’ page instead of the default error page when a user tries to access a link that does not exist, or if they try to edit a project they are not authorised to do so. </p>
                    <p>The functionality of the pages and forms was set up to match the API endpoints and database schema that was prepared using DRF in Part A. </p>
