                    <p>Our task was to create a portfolio site to showcase our work; and this site is the outcome of this project.</p>
                    <p>To meet the requirements of this project, my site needed to include a profile picture, biography, a functional contact form, sections dedicated to projects I have worked on and links to external sites (I have links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the content requirements, the technical requirements were to have at least 2 pages, be deployed on GitHub, be responsive and use semantic HTML.</p>
                    <p>I also included the following additional features: a different font colour when hovering over links, and a a simple JavaScript function to display a hidden message on my home page.</p>
