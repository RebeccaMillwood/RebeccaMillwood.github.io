                    <p>Our task was to create a portfolio site to showcase our work; and this site is the outcome of this project.</p>
                    <p>To meet the requirements of this project, my site needed to include a profile picture, biography, a functional contact form, sections dedicated to projects I have worked on and links to external sites (I have links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the content requirements, the technical requirements were to have at least 2 pages, be deployed on GitHub, be responsive and use semantic HTML.</p>
                    <p>I also included the following additional features: a different font colour when hovering over links, and a a simple JavaScript function to display a hidden message on my home page.</p>

                    <p>For this project, I was provided with two json files containing weather data; one contained a 5 day forecast, the other historical data for a 24 hour period. My task was to convert the data into something useful.</p>
                    <p>The requirements for this project were to write a Python script that produced: a summary of the forecast, a summary of each day and needed to meet specific output formatting, and pass tests that checked functions in my code (specifically the functions to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, calculate the Mean and the overall output function).</p>
                    <p>The second part of this project required two graphs to be produced, showing the minimum and maximum temperatures for each day, and the minimum, minimum ‘real feel’ and minimum ‘real feel shade’ temperatures. I used Plotly to produce two line graphs with the expected output.</p>
                    <p>Additional points to note were that all dates and times in the output needed to be in a human readable format, all temperatures needed to be converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius and displayed accordingly, all graphs needed a main title, titles for the X & Y axis and a legend.</p>
